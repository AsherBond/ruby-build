== Name

ruby-build - Download, compile, and install a version of Ruby.

== Synopsis

ruby-build [-kpv] _<definition>_ _<prefix>_ [-- _<configure-args...>_] +
ruby-build {--list|--definitions} +
ruby-build --version

== Description

ruby-build downloads, compiles, and installs a Ruby version named by the
_definition_ argument into the location specified by _prefix_. Optionally,
extra Ruby configure arguments may be added after "--".

The _definition_ argument can be a path to a file on disk, in which case
it is sourced into ruby-build as a bash script.

By default, all compile output is redirected to a log file at:
"$TMPDIR/ruby-build.*.log". Activate the verbose mode to skip the log file
and print everything to standard streams.
